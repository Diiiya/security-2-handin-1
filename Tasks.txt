(d) Which implementation would be better suited for Bobâ€™s remote
backup and why?

The AES Encryption in GCM mode will be better, because when using ECB mode even after encrypting, the image is still "readable"
because there is no randomness, not iv or something similar and thus all same colored pixel are simply transformed in other
color pixels but the content is still distinguishable.
